Usage
===

Download the zip by navigating to my github and clicking the green Clone or download button, followed by Download zip

Extract the contents to C: so they show up like this

C:\PSDK3v3-master\<files-here>

Rename PSDK3v3-master to PSDK3v3

That's it! Now you only need to send the msys batch file found at C:\PSDK3v3\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat to Desktop, so you can use it properly.

Enjoy :)
